SAPUI5 Application

A project created on the side when working for SAP. Project emailed a co-worker (Ron Nero) with the message (question preferably) that was typed in the textbox. 
Application allows for users to contact Ron Nero without him having to give out personal information. The name, picture and email can be manually switched out to any contact.

This was made to practice and enhance SAPUI5 skills.
